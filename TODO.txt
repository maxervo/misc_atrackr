* in sync
- sometimes division np problem "v cannot be empty" : OK
- graph of TEB is it good or not? improve it on the sides
- ok detect sync time at y(t) ? more precise than at vl(t)

* in register
- find the good CRC
- savemat gives weird result with nested dictionnaries

* in realsample
- do crc to pass step where they say not DF
- save nested dictionary with savemat, possible?
